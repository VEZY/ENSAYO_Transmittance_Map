# ENSAYO_Transmittance_Map

Project aim: 
Producing a map of the transmittance just above the coffee layer, at 2m high.
The transmittance is the light received at a given point. It depends on the PAR, the light 
interception by the layer above the point (here the shade Trees) and on the scattered light, which
is the light reflected by a given object, as the soil for exemple.

The transmittance map will be calculated using the MAESPA model present in the project, through the
test point routine. The ENSAYO trial map used in this project will not include the coffee layer in 
order to lower the computation time.
